# Zotero On Premise

Inspired from https://github.com/Zotero-Prime/zotero-prime

The goal of this repo is to make a more time proof version with zotero repo directly in dependancy.

Like the original repo, the goal is to self host zotero on small server.

I know that zotero business is to pay for storage and offer.
But I prefer to keep all my data on my own self hosted infrastructure.

## WIP repo do not use for now
